              I LOVE to create new and different things from scratch, that's why
              I've chosen the development career, tech makes possible to create
              an infinitude of things, things that help society in every kind of
              way, since from entertaining to medicine, with technology
              EVERYTHING is possible âœ¨ I'm obsessed with technology, maybe a
              little too much :p
